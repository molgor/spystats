# Sandboxes

Testing code for developing.

Here are some examples written in Python notebook format. These examples are explorations on models and techniques.

It is expected that, accordingly to an Agile methodology. The sandboxed scenarios get out from this stage into either:

1. A functional tutorial (iPython Notebook) 
2. Added functionalities to the software
3. Allways a Test module.


The files in here should be treated as early stages of experimentation.
